      <h1>WELCOME TO MY PERSONAL WEBPAGE</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to allow you to get to know me a little better and to have a better understanding of the life of Jameson Harrington Gaddis</p>
      <h2>Childhood</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Norcross, GA and I have lived there for 19 years. I grew up with two brothers, Logan and Patrick. I was the middle chile and without a doubt the favorite child. We all grew up playing sports together like hockey, lacrosse, and swimming. Being the middle child allowed me to learn from my older brothers mistakes while still being able to set a good example for my younger brother. We all attended Norcross High School and played varsity sports together. My family has had a huge impact on who I am today, especially my parents. My dad always taught me to work my hardest and to always give my best effort, while my mother taught me compassion for others and to always show love to those people around me. Without these family members, I would not be where I am today with the things I plan to accomplish tommorrow.</p>
      <h2>2018</h2>
      <p>Today I am currently enrolled as a fulltime student at the <span style="color:red;">University of Georgia</span>. I am Sport Management major with a minor in Legal Studies. I have always wanted to go into the sports field and knew that I wanted to major in it since high school. i hope to one day be a sports agent, coach, or atheltic director. At UGA, I have become involved in many clubs and programs. I am a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon as well as a volunteer for Extra Special People's 360 program. I am currently a Marketing and sales Intern for the UGA Atheltic Department as well. In high school, I started dating my best friend who now attends <span style="color:Blue;">Georgia </span><span style="color:yellow;">Tech! </span> and we have been dating for THREE years! I spend a lot of time with her in Athens and Atlanta.</p>
      <h2>More About Jameson</h2>
      <p>I am 100% confident that I am the biggest football fan you will ever meet. Of course I love the Georgia Bulldogs and the Atlanta Falcons, but I just love football in general. Just about every saturday in the fall you can find me on my couch watching football all day. I love to keep up with stats, records, and even recruiting. I dont play video games too often, but when I do I am definitely playing Madden or 2k. I love to spend time outdoors and go hiking, hunting, or fishing. The North Georgia mountains are my favorite plae to travel to and relax at. When it comes to food, I love to eat! To put it simply, I could never go vegetarian. I love to eat red meats and fish. I really enjoy going to new resteraunts and trying new dishes and would prefer to go to a local place than to a chain. One fact about me that most people dont know is that I love to buy shoes. I have over 30 shoes and I like to keep them clean and looking new. Im not a fan of sci fi movies and fantasy lands, but I love to watch documentaries on historical events, people, or places.</p>
      <h2>Social Media</h2>
	  <p> I am very active on all platforms of social media. I am usually posting updates about my life, posting highlights of events I've attended, or sharing content from others users of which I find valuable. I would love for you to follow along!</p>
